Hellbreaker uses Urho3D's game editor, which can be used to edit and create things such as node objects, UI layouts, materials, and particle effects.

The game editor can opened from the launcher or from `Tool/Editor.bat`.

Make sure the resource path is set to the game's `Data` directory.
You can set the resource path from `File -> Set resource path...`.

To learn how to use the editor use [Urho3D's editor instructions](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_editor_instructions.html).
