Hellbreaker uses Urho3D's game editor, which can be used to edit and create things such as game objects, UI layouts, materials, and particle effects.

The game editor can opened from the launcher or from `Tool/Editor.bat`.

Make sure you set the resource path to the game's `Data` directory.
You can set the resource path from `File -> Set resource path...`.
