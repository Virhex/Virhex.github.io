Welcome to the level editor's documentation.
Here you can learn how to use the level editor.


## Overview

The level editor is a fast to learn and easy to use tool for creating levels.

Level geometry is represented as shapes.
Each shape is made out of faces.
A face contains a polygon, and material properties: name, projection UV plane, and transformation.

Entities are used to describe things other than geometry, for example a light source or a moving shape.
There are two types of entities:
- Point entities, which use a position.
- Shape entities, which use shapes.

The level editor uses two kind of views:
- 3D view
- Grid view

Levels are saved in human readable JSON file with `.lvl` file extension.

The level editor also has a general level compiler.
Compiled levels use `.clvl` file extension.
